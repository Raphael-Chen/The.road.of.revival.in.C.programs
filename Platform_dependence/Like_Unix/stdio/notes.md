ISO C requires the following buffering characteristics.
- Standard input and standard output are fully buffered, if and only if they do not refer to an interactive device.
- Standard error is never fully buffered.

1. Fully buffered.  
   In this case, actual I/O takes place when the standard I/O buffer is filled. Files residing on disk are normally fully buffered by the standard I/O library. The buffer used is usually obtained by one of the standard I/O functions calling malloc (Section 7.8) the first time I/O is performed on a stream.

2. Line buffered.  In this case, the standard I/O library performs I/O when a newline character is encountered on input or output.
   This allows us to output a single character at a time (with the standard I/O fputc function), knowing that actual I/O will take place only when we finish writing each line. Line buffering is typically used on a stream when it refers to a terminal: standard input and standard output, for example.
