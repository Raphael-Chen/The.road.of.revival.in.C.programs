# The road of revival in C programs


>"Don't walk behind me; I may not lead. Don't walk in front of me; I may not follow. Just walk beside me and be my friend."

## Intro
It has been 30 years since the first version of C language standard (ANSI C) was released in 1989. In thirty years, I believe that all companies and research institutions in the world have used it to achieve all functions, but as intellectual property and technical barriers, those excellent frameworks and modules refined in the production process may only be stored in In their own machines, they serve their different business purposes, like some lonely islands. Because of this, other languages such as Java, Python, etc. are given opportunities to grow wildly. This should be said to be the sadness of the C language.

The development speed is getting faster and faster, the hardware consumption is getting higher and higher, and the knowledge reserves that developers should have are getting lower and lower, and they will eventually become tool people using wheels or be replaced by AI. I think this is not the final outcome that the developers want.
The software world does not need so many programming languages to solve the same problem repeatedly, just as the human world does not need so many languages to express the same meaning, because it greatly increases the cost of communication.
A biblical story is quoted in the IT classic "*The Mythical Man-Month*" to illustrate this point Chapter 7 "*Why Did the Tower of Babel Fail?*"

This is also my original intention to build such a project-to connect the islands. Introduction, collection of modules, implementation of projects, and refinement of the framework have revived the C language.
As long as the operating system is still developed in C for a day, it will not die.
Use code to solve practical problems instead of talking about theories.

**Just do it!**
